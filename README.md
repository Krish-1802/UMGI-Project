## Overview

This project proposes a business research & strategy approach for the music industry to engage fans directly and meaningfully. By building a proprietary *D2Fan (Direct-to-Fan)* platform, music labels like UMG can reclaim control over fan data and unlock new, scalable revenue streams. The initiative focuses on leveraging immersive technologies, creator-driven content, and localized strategies to deepen artist-fan connections.
